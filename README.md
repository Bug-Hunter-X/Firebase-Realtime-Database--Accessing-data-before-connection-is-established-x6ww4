# Firebase Realtime Database Connection Issue

This repository demonstrates a common error when working with the Firebase Realtime Database: attempting to access data before the connection is fully established.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The `initializeApp` function in Firebase is asynchronous.  Attempting to interact with the database immediately after calling it can lead to errors because the connection hasn't been fully established yet.

## Solution

The solution involves using promises or async/await to ensure the database connection is complete before attempting any data operations.  This ensures your code doesn't try to access the database prematurely.
